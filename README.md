Prediction of Uber demand in NYC
This is the final project in "Big Data" course, TAU 2018. i was required to analyze a dataset by Uber. and predict the demand
for Uber rides within 1 kilometer distance from the New York Stock Exchange, for each quarter
of hour, during the last week of September 2014. 
# For this I used 3 different datasets:
A. uber_train - This is the fundamental data I analyzed and use for modeling. This
file contains data on over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September
2014.

B. uber_test - For the list of time intervals in this data,I made my predictions, based on
the model i created.

C. External data source â€“ I used data of bikes rentals and train transporation in NYC

# This work was divided into 4 parts:
1. Data Rearrangement - cleaning and organizing the data
2. Exploratory Analysis -presenting and explaining descriptive statistics
3. Model Estimation
4. Predictions
